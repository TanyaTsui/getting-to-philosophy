    "# Getting to philosophy \n",
    "In the summer of 2008, wikipedia user Mark J discovered a strange phenomenon on wikipedia: if you click on the first link on a wikipedia page that isn't in brackets or italicized, then repeat the process, you usually end up on the page for philosophy. He wrote a [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy) about this, which led to mentions on a [podcast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikipediaWeekly/Episode50) and [documentary](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07lk6tj) (see snippet [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2DdmEBXTpo&t=90s&ab_channel=Wingspan)), as well as a [scientific paper](https://www.daniellamprecht.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Evaluating-and-Improving-Navigability-of-Wikipedia-a-Comparative-Study-of-eight-Language-Editions.pdf) published in 2016, which found that 97% of articles led to philosophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I'd like to find out if this phenomenon still exists on wikipedia today, in 2021. In order to do this, I will build a web scraper that goes through the process of clicking first links. Then, I will use this web scraper on a bunch (~3000?) of wikipedia pages, and keep a record of whether these pages get to philosophy, as well as all the links the web scraper had to click through to get there. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will then analyze the resulting dataset, and try to answer the following questions: \n",
    "* What is the percentage of pages that lead to philosophy? \n",
    "* What are some other popular pages that many pages eventually lead to? \n",
    "* What is the most beautiful way of visualizing this data? (I will use this beautiful [Game of Thrones character network visualization](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/game-thrones-social-network-analysis-conor-aspell/) as inspiration)\n",
    "* Which pages are highly connected to other pages, and which are not? (this is a chance to learn about and apply [network theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory), measuring [centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality) of points in a network)  "
